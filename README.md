### How to run

1. Download the latest release for your platform on the right of this page or [click here](https://github.com/e-caste/study-planner/releases)
2. Decompress the archive
3. Run the application

Some notes on point 3:
- on Windows, you will have to click "More info" and then "Run anyway" in the blue window that appears the first time you run the app
- on macOS, you will have to double click the app while holding control, only then you will have the option to "Open" the app
- on GNU/Linux, if you're using the Nautilus file manager (the default on Ubuntu), you will have to run the app from the terminal since double click does not work properly
